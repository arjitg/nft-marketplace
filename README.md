# NFT Marketplace

This is a web app that replicates NFT behavior using a fingerprinting algorithm to list, buy and sell unique images.

#### What is an NFT:
```A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique digital identifier that is recorded on a blockchain, and is used to certify ownership and authenticity. It cannot be copied, substituted, or subdivided.```
[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)

While an NFT can be anything digital, like an image, a song, a video, a piece of art, this marketplace only deals with images for now.
